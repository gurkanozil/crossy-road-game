# My 3D Crossy Road Clone!

This is my take on the classic Crossy Road game, rebuilt using TypeScript and Three.js. I'm thrilled to share it!

This project was a fantastic learning experience. I overcame several challenges, including:

- **Game Logic:** Implementing the core game mechanics, such as player movement, collision detection, and score tracking. I used a queue to manage player movements and bounding boxes for collision detection.
- **3D Modeling:** Creating the game's assets (cars, trucks, trees, roads) using Three.js's built-in primitives and materials. I aimed for a simple, visually appealing style reminiscent of the original Crossy Road.
- **Animation:** Animating the vehicles and the player using Three.js's animation capabilities and a custom animation loop. I used `THREE.Clock` to manage the timing of animations.
- **Scene Management:** Organizing the game world using Three.js's scene graph. I created reusable components for different game elements (roads, cars, trees).
- **User Interface:** Creating a simple UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the score and game over screen.

**Technologies Used:**

- **TypeScript:** For type safety and improved code organization.
- **Three.js:** For 3D rendering and scene management.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For the user interface and basic DOM manipulation.

**Key Methods and Techniques:**

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** I structured the code using classes to represent game objects (cars, trucks, trees, etc.).
- **Modular Design:** I broke down the code into smaller, reusable modules for better maintainability.
- **Event Handling:** I used event listeners to handle user input (keyboard controls).
- **Game Loop:** I implemented a game loop to update the game state and render the scene repeatedly.
- **Collision Detection:** I used bounding boxes to detect collisions between the player and vehicles.
- **Random Generation:** I used random number generation to create varied game levels.
